PROBE

Name:
    PROBE
 
Type:
    Support Command
 
Purpose:
    Print the contents of certain internal underlying Fortran variables.
 
Description:
    This command provides information which may assist in implementation
    and debugging.  Hence it is normally only used by
    the service group which implements DATAPLOT on your computer.
 
Syntax:
    PROBE   <name>
    where <name> is the underlying Fortran variable to print.
 
Examples:
    PROBE NUMCOL
    PROBE NUMNAM
    PROBE IBUGSU
 
Note:
    The list of the variables that can probed is documented under
    the SET command.  Enter HELP SET to examine the list.
 
Note:
    The PROBE command is used to return the values of certain
    internal parameters and strings.  This command was updated
    so that the returned value is automatically saved.  If the
    returned value is an integer or real number, then the value
    is stored in the internal parameter PROBEVAL.  If the
    returned value is a string, then the value is stored in the
    internal string PROBESTR.  PROBESTR and PROBEVAL can then be
    used in the same way as other parameters and strings.

    This feature is typically used in macros.  For example, you
    might want to use the machine maximum value as a "missing
    value" indicator.  A host independent way of using this value
    would now be:

       PROBE CPUMAX
       LET MACHMAX = PROBVAL

    You could then use the parameter MACHMAX wherever you wanted
    to define a missing value.

    This feature was implemented 1998/8.
