PEAKS
 
Name:
    PEAKS (LET)
 
Type:
    Let Subcommand
 
Purpose:
    Given a set of points (Y,X), filter the points to return the peaks
    of the data.  Alternatively, return the areas of the triangles formed
    by the peak points.
 
Description:
    A peak is defined as:

       1) a point that is strictly greater than both the point to the left and
          the point to the right

       2) a point that is strictly less than both the point to the left and
          the point to the right

    One complication is if there is a plateau of points.  For example,  given
    the points

             Index      X      Y
             ===================
             I-1        1      2
             I          2      4
             I+1        3      4
             I+2        4      4
             I+3        5      3

    In this case, we take the point (4,4) as the peak point.

Syntax 1:
    LET <y2> <x2> = PEAKS <y1> <x1>   <SUBSET/EXCEPT/FOR qualification>
    where <y1> is a variable containing the y-coordinates of the points;
          <x1> is a variable containing the x-coordinates of the points;
          <y2> is a variable containing the y-coordinates of the peak
               points;
          <x2> is a variable containing the x-coordinates of the peak
               points;
    and where the <SUBSET/EXCEPT/FOR qualification> is optional.
 
Syntax 2:
    LET <area>  = PEAK TRIANGLE AREAS <y1> <x1>
                                      <SUBSET/EXCEPT/FOR qualification>
    where <y1> is a variable containing the y-coordinates of the points;
          <x1> is a variable containing the x-coordinates of the points;
          <area> is a variable containing the areas of the triangles
               formed by the peak points;
    and where the <SUBSET/EXCEPT/FOR qualification> is optional.
 
Examples:
    LET Y2 X2 = PEAKS Y1 X1
    LET YAREA = PEAK TRIANGLE AREAS Y1 X1
 
Note:
    The values of the x-coordinates must all be unique.  If duplicate
    x-coordinates are detected, an error message will be returned.

    The data will be sorted by the values of the x-coordinates.
