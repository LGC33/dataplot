TEMPORARY FILE
 
Name:
    SET TEMPORARY FILE (SET)
 
Type:
    Set Subcommand
 
Purpose:
    If Dataplot cannot open the plot files (dppl1f.dat, dppl2f.dat),
    specify whether Dataplot should append the process-id to the name
    of the file and try again to open the file.
 
Description:
    On some operating systems, a file that is opened in write mode will
    lock other applications from also opening that file in write mode.
    This is the case on Microsoft Windows platforms.  Linux/Unix platforms
    allow multiple platforms to open the same file in write mode.

    So if you start multiple Dataplot sessions with the same current
    directory, only the first will be successful in opening the
    DEVICE 3 (dppl2f.dat) graphics output file.

    If a Dataplot session is unable to open the plot file in write mode,
    you can use this command to specify that Dataplot should append the
    process id to the name (specifically, dppl2f_<process-id>.dat) and
    try to open the file again.  The process id should give the plot file
    a unique name.

    On Linux/Unix systems, multiple Dataplot sessions will write to the
    same dppl2f.dat file.  This may result in a corrupt plot file, but
    it will not crash the Dataplot session.

    Although this command was implemented primarily with the DEVICE 3
    plot file in mind, it also applies to the DEVICE 2 plot file.  It
    currently does not apply to other temporary files (e.g., dpst1f.dat -
    dpst5f.dat).

Syntax:
    SET TEMPORARY FILE <PID/IGNORE>
    where <PID> specifies that Dataplot will append the process id and
                attempt to re-open the plot
               suppressed while <OFF> specifies that it will not.
 
Examples:
    SET TEMPORARY FILE ON
    SET TEMPORARY FILE OFF
    PROBE TEMPORARY FILE

Note:
    The SET TEMPORARY FILE ON will be ignored when running the graphical
    user interface (GUI) is running.

Default:
    OFF
 
Synonyms:
    None
